Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation.

Please follow the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2. Before posting anything, **please [read the visa wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/visas)** as it covers the most common visa situations. **IF YOU DON'T READ THIS, YOUR POST MAY BE REMOVED.** \n3. Please [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/index) and search past posts before asking your own question. **Posts containing queries already covered in the wiki or in past posts will also be removed.**\n4. Do some of your own research before asking a question here. The Internet is a great resource filled with **loads** of information related to [Japanese immigration rules and regulations](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/index.html). Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for! If you ask a question that has been answered a million times before, expect to be downvoted. If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like /r/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. No surveys, crowdsourcing or soliciting information for the purposes of projects, business development or otherwise.\n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned. Solicitation of anything in which you/the user will directly benefit is also prohibited (ie: referral codes, signup bonuses, recruitment bonuses). Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors. The intent of /r/movingtojapan is so users wishing to move to Japan can ask questions (and get clear, unvarnished answers) from the entire community \u2014 not just from one person.\n10. No \"meta\" posts about this sub. No PMs to individual mods about removed comments or posts. Problems or questions should be directed to moderators via the mod mail interface.\n\n**Other Japan-related subs**\n\n/r/japanlife - for people already living in Japan\n\n/r/LearnJapanese - for all your language Q&As\n\n/r/JapanCirclejerk - for the jaded jerk in all of us\n\n/r/japantravel - for those traveling to Japan short-term\n\n/r/teachinginjapan - for teachers past, present and prospective, \"\ncount_comments\":11}", "{ \"subreddit\":japanlife,\"\ntitle\":Residents in Japan,\"\ndescription\":/r/japanlife\u3078\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d!\n\nThis is the subreddit for people who **are living in Japan**\n\n---\n[The life in Japan wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/wiki/index)\n---\n\n#For questions about moving to Japan: /r/movingtojapan.\n\n---\n---\n\n#SUB RULES\n\n---\n\n1\\. ***SEARCH BEFORE YOU POST!!!!!*** \n\n---\n\n2\\. **Be respectful and civil.**\n\n* Sexism, racism, homophobia, personal attacks, trolling, and jerkishness are not allowed.

No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.\n\n* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.\n____________\n\n**Helpful Links**\n\n**[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gy8yn/stuff_for_the_faq_help_me_build_our_faq/)**\n\n**[How to Ask for Help in /r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/)**\n\n**[The Most Common Stories I Hear/Questions I Receive (A Personal FAQ)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7frtex/the_most_common_stories_i_hearquestions_i_receive/)**\n\nResources:\n\n* [Bachelor/Master/PhD programs in Europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wqzw3/websites_to_browse_for_bachelormasterphd/)\n\n* www.projectvisa.com (visa laws)\n\n* www.numbeo.com (costs of living etc. in different countries)\n\n* [If It Were My Home](http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/): Compare the average life in different countries\n\n* www.transitionsabroad.com\n\n* www.overseas-exile.com\n\n* The Friendly Canuck's Big Guide to How to Get In to Canada [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/16yayo/the_friendly_canucks_bigger_guide_to_how_to_get/)\n\n* [Excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://15miles.info/move-to-canada/)\n\n* [Another excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://correresmidestino.com/category/immigration/)\n\n\n* [Comprehensive guide to German visas](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/79304n/how_to_germany_work_study_the_ultimate_guide/)\n________________\n\n**Related Subreddits** \n\n[/r/LanguageLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/)\n\n/r/AskACountry (\"Learn about different cultures from the people living in them!\")\n\n/r/Travel\n\n/r/SoloTravel\n\n/r/IGotOut\n\n/r/Erasmus\n\n/r/LongDistance (long distance relationships)\n\n/r/SameGrassButGreener\n\n/r/IWantOutJobs\n\n/r/tefl (for English-teaching advice)\n\n/r/genealogy (for working out if you qualify for other citizenships)\n\n/r/AmericansInEurope\n\n/r/AskEurope\n\n/r/Multiculturalism\n\n/r/WWOOF\n\n/r/VisaMaps\n\n[Submit a text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/submit?text=Nationality%3A%0d%0dAge%3A%0d%0dLanguages%20spoken%3A%0d%0dProfessional%2Facademic%20qualifications%3A%0d%0dMotivations%3A%0d%0dBudget%3A%0d%0dTime%20frame%3A), \"\ncount_comments\":26}", "{ \"subreddit\":germany,\"\ntitle\":Germany,\"\ndescription\":English language content relating to Germany. **Posts in German will be removed**, please post them to /r/de for example.   \n\nEnglischsprachige Inhalte mit Bezug zu Deutschland. **Beitr\u00e4ge auf Deutsch werden entfernt**, bitte poste diese beispielsweise in /r/de.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**/r/de cultural exchange schedule:**  \n \n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Studying in Germany?

Reddit is not a substitute for a real lawyer.*\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n* Do not ask for advice on how to break the law. Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* /r/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* /r/ukvisa \n* /r/multiculturalism\n* /r/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration)., \"\ncount_comments\":6}", "{ \"subreddit\":Thailand,\"\ntitle\":Welcome to /r/Thailand,\"\ndescription\":###### Visiting Thailand?

Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made. Question posts may be removed if they can be answered on a [Google search](https://www.google.com) within two~ish pages of results. Ask a [mod](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea), the [general discussion thread](/r/korea/search?q=general+discussion+thread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week), or a [chatroom](/r/korea/wiki/index#wiki_chatrooms) for help.\n\n###3. Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5. No flooding of posts.\n\n* In order to prevent any one user from flooding the subreddit, excessively(more than two in 12 hours) posting is prohibited.\n* To prevent redundancies, posts may be removed if they don't provide sufficient and additional information.\n\n###6. No advertisement posts.\n\n* No posts for jobs, looking for jobs, renting an apartment, items for sale, etc.\n\n*General Guidelines:*\n\n* Please follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n* No overly inflammatory, racist, or offensive language.\n* No personal attacks toward other users or witch-hunting.\n* No reddit drama, meta or with other subreddits. Links to reddit must be [np](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro).\n* No URL shorteners.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* [Report](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-does-report-button-do) anything that violates the rules but remember that the report button is not a super-downvote and don't use it just because you don't like the content.\n* New accounts are given less tolerance.\n* [Message the moderating team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea) if you have a question about posting content or about the status of a post.\n\n---, \"\ncount_comments\":14}", "{ \"subreddit\":movingtojapan,\"\ntitle\":Moving to Japan - Everything you wanted to know (and probably a bit more),\"\ndescription\":So you want to move to Japan, but are confused about how to do it or where to even begin? \u304a\u3081\u3067\u3068\u3046!

Please follow the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2. Before posting anything, **please [read the visa wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/visas)** as it covers the most common visa situations. **IF YOU DON'T READ THIS, YOUR POST MAY BE REMOVED.** \n3. Please [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/index) and search past posts before asking your own question. **Posts containing queries already covered in the wiki or in past posts will also be removed.**\n4. Do some of your own research before asking a question here. The Internet is a great resource filled with **loads** of information related to [Japanese immigration rules and regulations](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/index.html). Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for! If you ask a question that has been answered a million times before, expect to be downvoted. If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like /r/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. No surveys, crowdsourcing or soliciting information for the purposes of projects, business development or otherwise.\n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned. Solicitation of anything in which you/the user will directly benefit is also prohibited (ie: referral codes, signup bonuses, recruitment bonuses). Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors. The intent of /r/movingtojapan is so users wishing to move to Japan can ask questions (and get clear, unvarnished answers) from the entire community \u2014 not just from one person.\n10.

Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* /r/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* /r/ukvisa \n* /r/multiculturalism\n* /r/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration)., \"\ncount_comments\":73}", "{ \"subreddit\":studyAbroad,\"\ntitle\":Info/tips for anyone that is planning to study abroad.,\"\ndescription\":A place for those redditors who are going to be studying abroad and who have studied abroad!\n\nThis is a discussion subreddit.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made. Question posts may be removed if they can be answered on a [Google search](https://www.google.com) within two~ish pages of results. Ask a [mod](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea), the [general discussion thread](/r/korea/search?q=general+discussion+thread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week), or a [chatroom](/r/korea/wiki/index#wiki_chatrooms) for help.\n\n###3. Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5. No flooding of posts.\n\n* In order to prevent any one user from flooding the subreddit, excessively(more than two in 12 hours) posting is prohibited.\n* To prevent redundancies, posts may be removed if they don't provide sufficient and additional information.\n\n###6. No advertisement posts.\n\n* No posts for jobs, looking for jobs, renting an apartment, items for sale, etc.\n\n*General Guidelines:*\n\n* Please follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n* No overly inflammatory, racist, or offensive language.\n* No personal attacks toward other users or witch-hunting.\n* No reddit drama, meta or with other subreddits.

No one really does. \n\nTo get an idea of who these people are, you should take a look at their [Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right), wherein they are explicitly described as:\n> \"White nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, neo-fascists, and other far right hate groups.\" \n\nThis is the alt-right we are concerned about.\n\n***\n\n###**Rules**  \n  \n1. **No Alt-Right/Nazis** This sub is a place for all those who oppose the Alt-Right/Nazis and their associated and supporting groups. Users from the following groups are prohibited from participating here: Alt-Right/Nazis, far-right, \u201calt-light,\u201d \u201cidentitarian,\u201d white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-confederates, incels, MAGA-cultists, q-anon qultists, gamergators, and members of any political affiliation whom the moderators of this sub deem to be enablers and supporters of the aforementioned groups. \n\n2. **Shitpost Properly, If At All** \nAvoid low-effort shitposts, such as reaction gifs, bad \"daily struggle\" comics, \u201cbanned from\u201d posts, \u201csearch results\u201d posts, and posts directly asking for upvotes. We tend to let the upvotes do the talking, but even if a really bad post hits r/all we will remove it.\n  \n3. **Focus on the Alt-Right**  \nThis sub targets the Alt-Right movement for condemnation and mockery. But with the entirety of the Right and even much of the center supporting and enabling the Alt-Right/Neo-Nazi agenda, the scope of this sub\u2019s focus is wider than just those who self-identify with the movement. Ultimately, responsibility for evaluating content\u2019s relevance to this sub rests with the sub\u2019s moderators. \n  \n4. **No Links to Prohibited Domains, Subreddits, and No Reposts** \nWe no longer allow direct links to Pro Alt Right / Neo-Nazi / or Trump content here. The reason being twofold: We don't want to give them traffic, and we also do not want to inadvertently help spread their racist filth and trash propaganda if one of our posts makes it to the front page. Please use Archive Links, Imgur, etc. Also please no reposts. Take a few seconds before submitting to make sure the content hasn't been posted here previously. \n  \n5. **Follow reddiquette and the TOS**\nNo bigotry of any kind. No advocating violence. No harassment. No brigading. Follow reddiquette and the terms of service. Please report breaches of reddit\u2019s code of conduct via the report system. \n\n6. **No Useful Idiots, Concern Trolls, or Edgelords**\nAlt-Right enabling*, Concern Trolls, and idiots calling for murder can fuck off. That being said, if you\u2019re concerned about the safety and well being of Nazis, we don\u2019t want to hear about that either. We're not your middle school debate club. \"Valuable Discussion\u2122\", \u201cBoth sides!\u201d bullshit and  \"Whataboutism\" are strictly prohibited per this rule. \n\n7. **No Username Pings** \nUsername mentions (hyperlinked usernames; i.e., \u201cpings\u201d) are not permitted in this sub, period. To engage mods, use modmail. \n\n8. **No Incivility between Left-Leaning Anti-Nazi Allies.** The sub is Fuckthealtright. It\u2019s not fuckliberals, fucksocialists, fuckcommunists, or fuckanarchists. Behave accordingly. Anyone Left of Center is welcome to participate. Incivility toward Alt-Right/Nazis is permissible, but follow the guideline: \u201c**REPORT then RETORT**.\u201d\n\n9. **Adults Only** Mature and reasonable participation is highly encouraged. Highly toxic and immature behavior may warrant a suspension. Please be mindful that participation in subs that engage in prohibited behavior such as harassment, brigading, doxing, and witch-hunting could get you banned as well. \n\n10. **Communicate With Mods Via Modmail Only** For All questions, comments, recommendations, or complaints regarding subreddit policies, rules, content, operations, or mod actions, communicate via modmail only. Do not directly contact mods via Private Messaging or Reddit Chat. Doing so is a violation of this rule and a bannable offense. Interpretation of the rules is left to moderator discretion. So please, no rules-lawyering. \n\n*Alt-right enablement is considered talking points which the Far Right might applaud or upvote. It doesn\u2019t necessarily imply explicit support of the Alt-Right.*\n\n**Important!:** Please see [Reddit\u2019s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) page.

Please follow the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2.

External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned.

Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors.

Not sure if Japan is the right place for you? We can help with that, too.\n\nExpect honest, frank discussions from those of us who have already completed the sometimes difficult and convoluted process of moving to Japan. You may not like the answers you get, but we are a sub that believes in 100% honesty and **zero sugarcoating**. We do, however, have a few ground rules, including:\n\n1. Please follow the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2. Before posting anything, **please [read the visa wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/visas)** as it covers the most common visa situations. **IF YOU DON'T READ THIS, YOUR POST MAY BE REMOVED.** \n3. Please [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/index) and search past posts before asking your own question. **Posts containing queries already covered in the wiki or in past posts will also be removed.**\n4. Do some of your own research before asking a question here. The Internet is a great resource filled with **loads** of information related to [Japanese immigration rules and regulations](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/index.html). Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for! If you ask a question that has been answered a million times before, expect to be downvoted. If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like /r/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. No surveys, crowdsourcing or soliciting information for the purposes of projects, business development or otherwise.\n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned. Solicitation of anything in which you/the user will directly benefit is also prohibited (ie: referral codes, signup bonuses, recruitment bonuses). Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors. The intent of /r/movingtojapan is so users wishing to move to Japan can ask questions (and get clear, unvarnished answers) from the entire community \u2014 not just from one person.\n10.
