Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam.

Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines.

Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* /r/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* /r/ukvisa \n* /r/multiculturalism\n* /r/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration)., \"count_comments\":35}", "{ \"subreddit\":90DayFiance,\"title\":90 Day Fiance,description\":Welcome to /r/90dayfiance, a community dedicated to the TLC show '90 Day Fiance' and it's spin-offs.

Please follow the [reddit content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2. Before posting anything, **please [read the visa wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/visas)** as it covers the most common visa situations. **IF YOU DON'T READ THIS, YOUR POST MAY BE REMOVED.** \n3. Please [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/wiki/index) and search past posts before asking your own question. **Posts containing queries already covered in the wiki or in past posts will also be removed.**\n4. Do some of your own research before asking a question here. The Internet is a great resource filled with **loads** of information related to [Japanese immigration rules and regulations](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/index.html). Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for!

If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like /r/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. No surveys, crowdsourcing or soliciting information for the purposes of projects, business development or otherwise.\n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned. Solicitation of anything in which you/the user will directly benefit is also prohibited (ie: referral codes, signup bonuses, recruitment bonuses). Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made. Question posts may be removed if they can be answered on a [Google search](https://www.google.com) within two~ish pages of results. Ask a [mod](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea), the [general discussion thread](/r/korea/search?q=general+discussion+thread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week), or a [chatroom](/r/korea/wiki/index#wiki_chatrooms) for help.\n\n###3. Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5. No flooding of posts.\n\n* In order to prevent any one user from flooding the subreddit, excessively(more than two in 12 hours) posting is prohibited.\n* To prevent redundancies, posts may be removed if they don't provide sufficient and additional information.\n\n###6. No advertisement posts.\n\n* No posts for jobs, looking for jobs, renting an apartment, items for sale, etc.\n\n*General Guidelines:*\n\n* Please follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n* No overly inflammatory, racist, or offensive language.\n* No personal attacks toward other users or witch-hunting.\n* No reddit drama, meta or with other subreddits.

Please read the sidebar for general advice and helpful links.*\n\nIf you want out of wherever you live, we're here to help.\n\nGot questions? Want advice and experience from people who have gotten out or are still trying? Have a good tip or a success story to tell? Just need support? No matter where you're from or where you're going, you're welcome here.\n\n###\u261eThis is a space to discuss strategies and advice for legal immigration, NOT to debate about refugees, undocumented migrants, the ethics/wisdom of various immigration policies, etc. Posts and comments that stray from the subject of legal immigration will be removed and you may be warned or banned depending on the severity of the offense. Report and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.\n\n_____________\n\n**\u2605 RULES \u2605**\n\n1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.\n\n* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.\n____________\n\n**Helpful Links**\n\n**[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gy8yn/stuff_for_the_faq_help_me_build_our_faq/)**\n\n**[How to Ask for Help in /r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/)**\n\n**[The Most Common Stories I Hear/Questions I Receive (A Personal FAQ)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7frtex/the_most_common_stories_i_hearquestions_i_receive/)**\n\nResources:\n\n* [Bachelor/Master/PhD programs in Europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wqzw3/websites_to_browse_for_bachelormasterphd/)\n\n* www.projectvisa.com (visa laws)\n\n* www.numbeo.com (costs of living etc. in different countries)\n\n* [If It Were My Home](http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/): Compare the average life in different countries\n\n* www.transitionsabroad.com\n\n* www.overseas-exile.com\n\n* The Friendly Canuck's Big Guide to How to Get In to Canada [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/16yayo/the_friendly_canucks_bigger_guide_to_how_to_get/)\n\n* [Excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://15miles.info/move-to-canada/)\n\n* [Another excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://correresmidestino.com/category/immigration/)\n\n\n* [Comprehensive guide to German visas](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/79304n/how_to_germany_work_study_the_ultimate_guide/)\n________________\n\n**Related Subreddits** \n\n[/r/LanguageLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/)\n\n/r/AskACountry (\"Learn about different cultures from the people living in them!\")\n\n/r/Travel\n\n/r/SoloTravel\n\n/r/IGotOut\n\n/r/Erasmus\n\n/r/LongDistance (long distance relationships)\n\n/r/SameGrassButGreener\n\n/r/IWantOutJobs\n\n/r/tefl (for English-teaching advice)\n\n/r/genealogy (for working out if you qualify for other citizenships)\n\n/r/AmericansInEurope\n\n/r/AskEurope\n\n/r/Multiculturalism\n\n/r/WWOOF\n\n/r/VisaMaps\n\n[Submit a text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/submit?text=Nationality%3A%0d%0dAge%3A%0d%0dLanguages%20spoken%3A%0d%0dProfessional%2Facademic%20qualifications%3A%0d%0dMotivations%3A%0d%0dBudget%3A%0d%0dTime%20frame%3A), \"count_comments\":26}", "{ \"subreddit\":ABCDesis,\"title\":ABCDesis,description\":##### **South Asian Americans**\n\nOur purpose at /r/ABCDesis is to foster a sense of community among the South Asian Diaspora.  \n\n\n\n#####**SCHEDULED THREADS:**\n\n* **Sunday:** Dating\n* **Monday:** Entertainment\n* **Tuesday:** Career & Academic advice [1]\n* **Wednesday:** Banter\n* **Thursday:** Tiffin Thursday\n* **Friday:** Eff Yeah Friday!\n* **Saturday:** Fashion & Fitness\n\n[1] \u2014  posted every 1st and 3rd Tuesday\n\n[2] \u2014 an \u2018introduce yourself\u2019 thread will be posted during the first week of each month\n\n**[Click here to see our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/wiki/index)** for more detailed info about /r/ABCDesis, including our [**Crisis Resources list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/abcdesis/wiki/crisis_resources) and other original material, community-sourced info, and related subreddits.\n\n---\n   \n###[C]  \n\nWhile the origin of ABCD has the \"C\" standing in for \"confused\", we've chosen to leave its interpretation up to our members.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made. Question posts may be removed if they can be answered on a [Google search](https://www.google.com) within two~ish pages of results. Ask a [mod](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea), the [general discussion thread](/r/korea/search?q=general+discussion+thread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week), or a [chatroom](/r/korea/wiki/index#wiki_chatrooms) for help.\n\n###3. Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5. No flooding of posts.\n\n* In order to prevent any one user from flooding the subreddit, excessively(more than two in 12 hours) posting is prohibited.\n* To prevent redundancies, posts may be removed if they don't provide sufficient and additional information.\n\n###6. No advertisement posts.\n\n* No posts for jobs, looking for jobs, renting an apartment, items for sale, etc.\n\n*General Guidelines:*\n\n* Please follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n* No overly inflammatory, racist, or offensive language.\n* No personal attacks toward other users or witch-hunting.\n* No reddit drama, meta or with other subreddits.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made.

Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5.

But with the entirety of the Right and even much of the center supporting and enabling the Alt-Right/Neo-Nazi agenda, the scope of this sub\u2019s focus is wider than just those who self-identify with the movement.

Highly toxic and immature behavior may warrant a suspension. Please be mindful that participation in subs that engage in prohibited behavior such as harassment, brigading, doxing, and witch-hunting could get you banned as well. \n\n10. **Communicate With Mods Via Modmail Only** For All questions, comments, recommendations, or complaints regarding subreddit policies, rules, content, operations, or mod actions, communicate via modmail only. Do not directly contact mods via Private Messaging or Reddit Chat. Doing so is a violation of this rule and a bannable offense. Interpretation of the rules is left to moderator discretion.

However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines.

We call this socialism.*\n\nFind out more here: **[The Principles of Communism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)**\n\n---\n\n#*Rules:*\n\n**1. Reddit-wide rules apply.** Behavior such as brigading and harassment won't be permitted. Neither will posts that can be interpreted as explicit threats of/calls for violence.\n\n**2. No trolling.** \"I was just trolling\" won't be accepted as a defense for breaking rules, and we will ban for intentionally disruptive behavior or attacks on our sub, users, or philosophy.\n\n**3. No capitalist apologia or anti-socialism.** This subreddit is intended for a socialist audience, and while questions are allowed, pushing your own counter-narrative here is not. We do not allow support here for capitalism or for the parties or ideologies that uphold it. We are not a liberal or (U.S.-/Social-) Democrat subreddit; we are a socialist subreddit.\n\n**4. No imperialism or reactionism.** This includes not just ideologies to the right of liberalism but also right-wing fixations such as national/ethnic/cultural chauvinism and military/police worship regardless of the underlying ideology.\n\n**5. No bigotry.** No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or classism. The respect for readers who are subject to these forms of bigotry takes priority in this subreddit over your right to speak freely. \n\n* [This subreddit stands against hate speech](http://redd.it/3djkz4).\n* We are not open to \"brocialist\" downplaying of these issues.\n\n**6. Be nice to each other.** Be respectful towards other socialists you disagree with, but also non-socialists who follow the rules and participate in good faith. Feel free to dunk on trolls, bigots and bootlickers to your heart\u2019s content.\n\n**7. Bans are at moderator discretion.** We reserve the right to eject users (as well as remove, lock, or otherwise moderate any content on the subreddit) for reasons not listed if we consider it necessary to do so.\n\n**8. Don\u2019t bother sending us personal promotion requests.** We are not an advertising platform for your blog or Youtube channel.\n\n**9. Do not post NSFL Content;** it will be removed.\n\n**10. This is not a debate subreddit.** Constructive questions and discussion are welcome, but our basic philosophy is non-negotiable and we aren\u2019t interested in repeatedly having to explain or justify it. We also won\u2019t debate about so-called \u201csocialist\u201d countries. There are plenty of political debate subreddits, so take your gotchas there.

No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.\n\n* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.\n____________\n\n**Helpful Links**\n\n**[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gy8yn/stuff_for_the_faq_help_me_build_our_faq/)**\n\n**[How to Ask for Help in /r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/)**\n\n**[The Most Common Stories I Hear/Questions I Receive (A Personal FAQ)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7frtex/the_most_common_stories_i_hearquestions_i_receive/)**\n\nResources:\n\n* [Bachelor/Master/PhD programs in Europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wqzw3/websites_to_browse_for_bachelormasterphd/)\n\n* www.projectvisa.com (visa laws)\n\n* www.numbeo.com (costs of living etc. in different countries)\n\n* [If It Were My Home](http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/): Compare the average life in different countries\n\n* www.transitionsabroad.com\n\n* www.overseas-exile.com\n\n* The Friendly Canuck's Big Guide to How to Get In to Canada [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/16yayo/the_friendly_canucks_bigger_guide_to_how_to_get/)\n\n* [Excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://15miles.info/move-to-canada/)\n\n* [Another excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://correresmidestino.com/category/immigration/)\n\n\n* [Comprehensive guide to German visas](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/79304n/how_to_germany_work_study_the_ultimate_guide/)\n________________\n\n**Related Subreddits** \n\n[/r/LanguageLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/)\n\n/r/AskACountry (\"Learn about different cultures from the people living in them!\")\n\n/r/Travel\n\n/r/SoloTravel\n\n/r/IGotOut\n\n/r/Erasmus\n\n/r/LongDistance (long distance relationships)\n\n/r/SameGrassButGreener\n\n/r/IWantOutJobs\n\n/r/tefl (for English-teaching advice)\n\n/r/genealogy (for working out if you qualify for other citizenships)\n\n/r/AmericansInEurope\n\n/r/AskEurope\n\n/r/Multiculturalism\n\n/r/WWOOF\n\n/r/VisaMaps\n\n[Submit a text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/submit?text=Nationality%3A%0d%0dAge%3A%0d%0dLanguages%20spoken%3A%0d%0dProfessional%2Facademic%20qualifications%3A%0d%0dMotivations%3A%0d%0dBudget%3A%0d%0dTime%20frame%3A), \"count_comments\":106}", "{ \"subreddit\":Shitstatistssay,\"title\":We all need to vent sometimes,description\":# Join our discord here, all subreddit rules apply: https://discord.gg/dzxvwGg\n\n\n-----\n#This is where we come to laugh at the insane things that Statists say and do. \n\n#Content found on Reddit is encouraged but feel free to link elsewhere.

No hate speech, personal attacks or trolling.**\n\n* **No housing ads.** Not for your flat, not for your Airbnb, not for couchsurfing, not for **nada.**\n\n* **No job ads.** Not for academies, not for au pairs, not for private classes, not for **nada.** \n\n* **No self-promotion.** That means blogs, social media profiles, etc. You may post a link to your blog or social media profile in comments to help users asking questions relevant to what you have to offer.\n\n* **No spam.**\n\n> Useful Links\n\n*[/r/andalucia](https://www.reddit.com/r/andalucia/)\n\n*[/r/barcelona](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barcelona/)\n\n*[/r/catalonia](https://www.reddit.com/r/catalonia/)\n\n*[/r/es](https://www.reddit.com/r/es/)\n\n*[/r/euskadi](https://www.reddit.com/r/euskadi/)\n\n*[/r/galicia](https://www.reddit.com/r/galicia/)\n\n*[/r/granada](https://www.reddit.com/r/granada/)\n\n*[/r/malaga](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaga/)\n\n*[/r/Madrid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Madrid/)\n\n*[/r/sevilla](https://www.reddit.com/r/sevilla/)\n\n*[/r/valencia](https://www.reddit.com/r/valencia/)\n, \"count_comments\":4}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Sumaelora,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Sumaelora,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Gayatri01234,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Gayatri01234,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Sumaelora,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_Sumaelora,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":FreedomNewsPolitics,\"title\":Freedom, News, & Politics,description\":#announcement text, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":BreitbartNews,\"title\":Breitbart News,description\":#[BREITBART.com](http://www.breitbart.com/)\n\n# GENERAL RULES\n\n1.

Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for!

If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like /r/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. No surveys, crowdsourcing or soliciting information for the purposes of projects, business development or otherwise.\n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs, social media accounts or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users may be banned.

Promotion of businesses **except** in the case of genuine recommendations from users, are strictly prohibited. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors.

Report and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.\n\n_____________\n\n**\u2605 RULES \u2605**\n\n1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.\n\n* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.\n____________\n\n**Helpful Links**\n\n**[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gy8yn/stuff_for_the_faq_help_me_build_our_faq/)**\n\n**[How to Ask for Help in /r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/)**\n\n**[The Most Common Stories I Hear/Questions I Receive (A Personal FAQ)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7frtex/the_most_common_stories_i_hearquestions_i_receive/)**\n\nResources:\n\n* [Bachelor/Master/PhD programs in Europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wqzw3/websites_to_browse_for_bachelormasterphd/)\n\n* www.projectvisa.com (visa laws)\n\n* www.numbeo.com (costs of living etc. in different countries)\n\n* [If It Were My Home](http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/): Compare the average life in different countries\n\n* www.transitionsabroad.com\n\n* www.overseas-exile.com\n\n* The Friendly Canuck's Big Guide to How to Get In to Canada [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/16yayo/the_friendly_canucks_bigger_guide_to_how_to_get/)\n\n* [Excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://15miles.info/move-to-canada/)\n\n* [Another excellent resource on immigrating to Canada](http://correresmidestino.com/category/immigration/)\n\n\n* [Comprehensive guide to German visas](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/79304n/how_to_germany_work_study_the_ultimate_guide/)\n________________\n\n**Related Subreddits** \n\n[/r/LanguageLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/)\n\n/r/AskACountry (\"Learn about different cultures from the people living in them!\")\n\n/r/Travel\n\n/r/SoloTravel\n\n/r/IGotOut\n\n/r/Erasmus\n\n/r/LongDistance (long distance relationships)\n\n/r/SameGrassButGreener\n\n/r/IWantOutJobs\n\n/r/tefl (for English-teaching advice)\n\n/r/genealogy (for working out if you qualify for other citizenships)\n\n/r/AmericansInEurope\n\n/r/AskEurope\n\n/r/Multiculturalism\n\n/r/WWOOF\n\n/r/VisaMaps\n\n[Submit a text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/submit?text=Nationality%3A%0d%0dAge%3A%0d%0dLanguages%20spoken%3A%0d%0dProfessional%2Facademic%20qualifications%3A%0d%0dMotivations%3A%0d%0dBudget%3A%0d%0dTime%20frame%3A), \"count_comments\":19}", "{ \"subreddit\":DescentIntoTyranny,\"title\":The Descent into Tyranny,description\": 1. \"A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all.\" - Edward Snowden\n\nLike the Roman Republic under Caesar Augustus, the American Republic is rapidly sliding into a system that limits individual liberty, that limits influence of its citizens, that produces ever greater separation between rich and poor, and pursues permanent war for the benefit of a tiny fraction of Americans.

Reddit is not a substitute for a real lawyer.*\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n* Do not ask for advice on how to break the law. Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* /r/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* /r/ukvisa \n* /r/multiculturalism\n* /r/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration)., \"count_comments\":8}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_ZnosShrestha,\"title\":,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_paragongroupsangrur,\"title\":Paragon group immigration  ,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":u_MoneyMantanTV,\"title\":Money Mantan TV,description\":, \"count_comments\":0}", "{ \"subreddit\":ukvisa,\"title\":UK Visa Advice & News,description\":A community to seek or provide advice for people applying for visas to stay or live in the UK.\n\n#**[Please read the rules before posting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/about/rules/)**\n\nKey links:  \n\n*  [UK.Gov - Visas & Immigration](https://www.gov.uk/visas-immigration)\n* [Looking to move to the UK?

Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates.

Your hand and at least an implication of a complete arm must be visible.\n\n * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.\n\n * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.\n\n * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet.

Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.\n\n * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.\n\n * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on \"Best Of\" and \"Highlights\" albums.\n\n * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.\n\n * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.\n\n * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.\n\n * No NSFW material. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.\n\n**Roasters:**\n\n * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.\n \n * You are allowed to look through the roastee's post history.\n\n * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.\n\n * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.\n\n * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)\n\n   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**\n\nIf you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.\n\n***\n\n**Attention:**\n\nIf you are suffering from depression, bipolar, suicidal thoughts or any other mental health issues, please immediately contact help services through the following links- there is always help if you need it.\n\n**Links:**\n\nUnited States:\n\n* [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)\n* [Samaritans](http://www.samaritans.org/)\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\n* [Samaritans](http://www.samaritans.org/)\n* [Papyrus](https://www.papyrus-uk.org/)\n\nAustralia:\n\n* [Lifeline](https://www.lifeline.org.au/)\n* [Kids Helpline](https://kidshelpline.com.au/)\n\nIf your country was not in this list, look up your country in this [larger list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) and contact your local services.

High Fashion has always significantly influenced streetwear, but these brands are not necessarily the focus of the genre. The importance of logos and brand recognition (mainstream and underground) play a large part in increasing what is considered popular in the genre. \n\nAlthough streetwear is generally considered to be a more masculine leaning style, both androgynous and feminine styles of streetwear have risen in popularity.

Thinly veiled advertisements will also be deleted. Repeat offenders will be banned. (Unless explicitly relevant, this includes YouTube videos, blogposts, and sale announcements.)\n\n5.

We expect that users do not use this forum to build a brand, for financial gain, or to attempt to gain traffic or users. This also extends to PM'ing users because of comments they made on this subreddit, and the solicitation of referral promotions. \n\n4) **IamAs/AMAs must be approved by mods**\n\nIf you'd like to host an \"I Am A/Ask Me Anything\" (IamA/AMA) thread, you must first [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPersonalFinanceCanada) for approval. We will evaluate if your topic is suitable for the subreddit and will set a date to avoid conflicts. Unapproved AMAs may be removed without notice at the moderator's discretion.\n\n####Posting guidelines\n\n**Include your province in your post!**\n\n**Include sources.**\n\nA good answer will be supported by relevant and reliable sources. Answers that link only to your personal blog or website are considered low-quality and may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\n**Have an in-depth answer.**\n\nUse a mix of context, explanation, and sources in your answer. Do not just post links to other sites as an answer. If you do believe a source fully answers a question then consider including a quote from the source. \n\n**Be inquisitive, and clear if you are unsure.**\n\nIf you have heard or read something which might be related to the question, and you want to check it, then make sure you ask it as a question. Do not post \"I'm not sure if this is true...\" or \"Someone will correct me if I'm wrong.\" If you're not actually answering the question, then make sure your comment looks like a question.\n\n####Wiki / Frequently asked questions\n\n[Reading list / recommended books](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/reading-list)\n\n[Step by step guide of what to prioritize / what to do with money](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)\n\n[Frequently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/faq)\n\n[**Wiki index with many more subjects**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/index)\n\n\n####Related subreddits\n\n/r/personalfinance\n\n/r/investing\n\n/r/CanTax\n\n/r/CanadianInvestor\n\n/r/FinancialIndependence\n\n/r/fican\n\n\n####Bot Triggers\n\nTrigger|Description\n---------|----------\n!InvestingTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer in order to get proper advice about whether investing is appropriate for them.\n!CCTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer to get proper advice about recommending credit cards to them\n!MarginalTrigger | An example, using $15,000 of income and made up tax brackets, about how tax brackets work.

It has layers. What is unpopular in your suburb may be popular in your city, unpopular in your state, and popular in your country, for example. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular, but do not use an unreasonably small or obscure niche to justify your opinion's unpopularity.\n\nExpect blatantly popular posts to earn you a ban (e.g. \"murder is bad\", \"Hitler probably shouldn't have killed all those people\", etc).\n\n- RULE 2: **Your post MUST be an opinion**\n\nNot a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. And remember, it must be unpopular (see rule 1).\n\nPlease have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way (see rule 3). This allows for the most comfortable browsing of the subreddit for our users.\n\n- RULE 3: **No low effort posts/elaborate**\n\nAny opinion that is not well thought out, incoherent, internally contradictory or otherwise nonsensical is subject to removal.\n\nYou must elaborate on your opinion and justify your position, to save your fellow users from needing to ask an array of follow up questions to simply understand why you believe what you believe.\n\n- RULE 4: **No trolling/satire**\n\nTrolling is making random unsolicited comments that serve to intentionally provoke a knee jerk reaction. Satire is constructing an absurd or ironic narrative on a topic in order to provoke same.\n\nExpect both of these to earn permanent bans.\n\n- RULE 5: **Be civil**\n\nThis is a discussion subreddit for people to share ideas that may be inappropriate or even offensive in everyday life. We understand such conversations can get heated, and you are not obliged to be polite, but be aware that resorting to personal attacks, insults and other tribalistic behaviour is likely to earn you a ban. If somebody insults or attacks you first, report it, it will be dealt with.\n\n- RULE 6: **No hate posts/comments**\n\nSome opinions are so inappropriate or offensive that they will be removed by the moderators as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.\n\nIf you wish to express your distaste, disgust, or hatred for an above-mentioned group, do it elsewhere. Better yet, don't do it at all.\n\n- RULE 7: **Do not break sitewide rules**\n\nWhen you created your account, you agreed to abide by reddit's terms of service and its content policy. As subreddit moderators, we are obliged to enforce these rules, and failure to do so can jeopardise the entire subreddit. As such, expect them to be enforced strictly and without second chances.\n\nThis includes telling users to commit suicide, threatening/wishing for violence, eugenics, sexualising minors, doxxing, and harassment.\n\n- RULE 8: **No reposting/circlejerking**\n\nPosts need to be substantially different from any other posted recently.\n\nIf you wish to comment on a common or popular topic that has been posted in the last 24 hours, do that, comment on that post. Do not create a new post, even if your position is the opposite of that in the post you're replying to.\n\nIf you wish to post about a recent newsworthy event, STOP. Use the search function. Check the \"Hot\" posts for either a massive post on the topic, or a sticky'd megathread, and comment there.\n\n- RULE 9: **Megathread topics**\n\nSome topics are so popularly discussed that were we to allow them as regular posts on the subreddit, you would see little to nothing else. As such, we confine them to megathreads.\n\nAt the top of the Hot section we have sticky'd a \"Popular Topics Megahub\". Inside you will find all the megathreads for the most commonly posted opinions. If you wish to discuss one of these topics, do it there, so the rest of the subreddit doesn\u2019t drown in these posts.\n\n- RULE 10: **No politics**\n\nVirtually every corner of the internet, including most of reddit, is a place for the left and the right to fight tooth and nail over issues they passionately refuse to compromise on. We get it, the guy who believes the other thing is the big evils.\n\nWe would like to limit political bickering here. You are welcome to discuss topics indirectly related to politics, but be aware that your bog standard political opinion (on abortion, guns, healthcare, etc) is controversial, but is NOT unpopular.\n\n- RULE 11: **No meta posts**\n\nA meta post is one that discusses the subreddit itself. Please do not make these posts, whether positive, negative or neutral, as the purpose of the subreddit is not to discuss the subreddit. Use the megathread. Expect a ban for breaking this rule.\n\n\n**Shout out's**\n\nMany thanks to u/MrEdinLaw for creating our UnpopularOpinion Bot!\n\n**Related Subreddits**\n-  \n\n- /r/changemyview  \n- /r/Rant\n\n---------------------------------, \"count_comments\":47}", "{ \"subreddit\":learnmath,\"title\":Learn Math,description\":###[PSA] [Set your post to \"Resolved\" when answered.](http://redd.it/1lcxx6) | [PSA] *[Each post must include a specific title and description.](http://redd.it/1mq7n1)*\n---\nThink /r/math is too advanced?  \n# *Here,* **the only stupid question is the one you don't ask.**\n\nThis is a subreddit for learning math, and can be seen as a sister subreddit to /r/math.

Posts should be on topic.\n\n* Posts should be about news, culture, and life in Korea. They may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Korea. This can include translation requests, celebrity news, music videos, tech news, etc, esp. if they have no larger relevance to Korea.\n\n###2. Check before posting a question.\n\n* Check the Wiki, FAQ, browse the front page, or use the search box to see if a relevant post was made. Question posts may be removed if they can be answered on a [Google search](https://www.google.com) within two~ish pages of results. Ask a [mod](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea), the [general discussion thread](/r/korea/search?q=general+discussion+thread&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=week), or a [chatroom](/r/korea/wiki/index#wiki_chatrooms) for help.\n\n###3. Don't editorialize news posts.\n\n* Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. Summarizing an article in the title is ok, but keep it free of opinion, commentary, or loaded language not contained in the article.\n\n###4. Post in English or Korean.\n\n* Although this subreddit is about Korea, its users are primarily English speakers. We welcome Korean language links, but we encourage Korean language posts to have an objective, English summary in the comments.\n\n###5. No flooding of posts.\n\n* In order to prevent any one user from flooding the subreddit, excessively(more than two in 12 hours) posting is prohibited.\n* To prevent redundancies, posts may be removed if they don't provide sufficient and additional information.\n\n###6. No advertisement posts.\n\n* No posts for jobs, looking for jobs, renting an apartment, items for sale, etc.\n\n*General Guidelines:*\n\n* Please follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n* No overly inflammatory, racist, or offensive language.\n* No personal attacks toward other users or witch-hunting.\n* No reddit drama, meta or with other subreddits. Links to reddit must be [np](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro).\n* No URL shorteners.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* [Report](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-does-report-button-do) anything that violates the rules but remember that the report button is not a super-downvote and don't use it just because you don't like the content.\n* New accounts are given less tolerance.\n* [Message the moderating team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkorea) if you have a question about posting content or about the status of a post.\n\n---, \"count_comments\":27}", "{ \"subreddit\":worldnews,\"title\":World News,description\":>>> - **Other Subs:**\n\n>>> - [Related](http://goo.gl/ztbbza)\n>>>     - /r/News\n>>>     - /r/PoliticalDiscussion\n>>>     - /r/WorldEvents\n>>>     - /r/GeoPolitics\n>>>     - /r/GlobalTalk \n>>>     - /r/Business\n>>>     - /r/Economics\n>>>     - /r/Environment\n>>>     - /r/History\n>>>     - /r/HumanRights\n>>>     - /r/Features\n>>>     - /r/UpliftingNews\n>>>     - /r/NewsOfTheWeird\n>>>     - /r/FakeNews\n>>>     - /r/ID_News \n\n>>> - [N.

**Posts must be about personal finance in Canada**\n\nThis covers a very wide variety of topics, including banking, employment, budgeting, minimizing recurring or popular expenses, advice for large purchases, and more. \n\n2) **Be helpful and respectful**\n\nBe patient with others. Keep disagreements polite. You can feel free to be \"harsh\", but **never insulting**. Refrain from \"judging\" the financial situation of others - whether their situation is dire or well-off. Comments suggesting that sharing financial information in a personal finance subreddit is a \"humblebrag\" will be removed. \n\n3) **Avoid most self-promotion**\n\nThis includes solicitation of referrals, posting your own blog, video channel or personal website, and recommendations for users to do business with you. We expect that users do not use this forum to build a brand, for financial gain, or to attempt to gain traffic or users. This also extends to PM'ing users because of comments they made on this subreddit, and the solicitation of referral promotions. \n\n4) **IamAs/AMAs must be approved by mods**\n\nIf you'd like to host an \"I Am A/Ask Me Anything\" (IamA/AMA) thread, you must first [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPersonalFinanceCanada) for approval. We will evaluate if your topic is suitable for the subreddit and will set a date to avoid conflicts. Unapproved AMAs may be removed without notice at the moderator's discretion.\n\n####Posting guidelines\n\n**Include your province in your post!**\n\n**Include sources.**\n\nA good answer will be supported by relevant and reliable sources. Answers that link only to your personal blog or website are considered low-quality and may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\n**Have an in-depth answer.**\n\nUse a mix of context, explanation, and sources in your answer. Do not just post links to other sites as an answer. If you do believe a source fully answers a question then consider including a quote from the source. \n\n**Be inquisitive, and clear if you are unsure.**\n\nIf you have heard or read something which might be related to the question, and you want to check it, then make sure you ask it as a question. Do not post \"I'm not sure if this is true...\" or \"Someone will correct me if I'm wrong.\" If you're not actually answering the question, then make sure your comment looks like a question.\n\n####Wiki / Frequently asked questions\n\n[Reading list / recommended books](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/reading-list)\n\n[Step by step guide of what to prioritize / what to do with money](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)\n\n[Frequently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/faq)\n\n[**Wiki index with many more subjects**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/index)\n\n\n####Related subreddits\n\n/r/personalfinance\n\n/r/investing\n\n/r/CanTax\n\n/r/CanadianInvestor\n\n/r/FinancialIndependence\n\n/r/fican\n\n\n####Bot Triggers\n\nTrigger|Description\n---------|----------\n!InvestingTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer in order to get proper advice about whether investing is appropriate for them.\n!CCTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer to get proper advice about recommending credit cards to them\n!MarginalTrigger | An example, using $15,000 of income and made up tax brackets, about how tax brackets work.

Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.\n\nThis is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. \n\nAfter 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  \n\n#[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\nVisit our sister subreddit /r/AmItheButtface/ for posts about fiction or relationships, and basically anything that we don't allow here!\n\nSee our *~~Best Of~~* \"Most Controversial\" at /r/AITAFiltered \n___\n\n#**Rules**\n\n##1. Be Civil\n\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this space is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives.\n\nThis rule applies to everyone (even those outside of Reddit). Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\n##2. Voting Rules\n\nUpvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.\n\nIn the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you or for merely commenting on their own post unless they are being abusive or argumentative.\n\n##3. Accept Your Judgment\n\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n\n##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\n\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. People will come back to see what consensus was reached in your thread. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n\n##5. No Violence\n\nDon't even *mention* violence.\n\nIf your post references violence, don't share it here. Threads which mention violence are difficult to moderate, we have to remove all comments which encourage or incite violence. It's difficult to do this in a thread which discusses violence.\n\nComments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **This is a zero tolerance policy.** \n\n##6. How To Post\n\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\n\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here.\n\n##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\n\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\n\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, or a third party who\u2019s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n\n##8. No Shitposts\n\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible.\n\nThis is not a humor sub. This is not a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, or creative writing exercises. Don't copy someone else's story and post it from the opposite viewpoint or with some details changed.\n\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n\n##9. Do Not Ask For Advice\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\n\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\n\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n\n##10. Meta Posts and Updates Require Permission\n\nIf you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned. Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META.\n\nPlease request mod approval after you submit your META post or your update post. Make sure the title of your meta post starts with META and the title of your update post starts with UPDATE. See our FAQ for more guidelines.\n\n##11. No breakups/hookups\n\nWe do not allow submissions where the central conflict is a relationship and instead recommend a relationship focused sub.\n\nThe following posts are forever banned:\n\nAITA for breaking up with _ (or not)\n\nAITA for dating _ (or not)\n\nAITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)\n\nAITA for being attracted to _ (or not)\n\nAnd any discussions related to cheating- including \"telling on\" someone for cheating (or not doing so).\n\nAnd similar discussions.\n\n##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue, it is not appropriate for this sub. This may include anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to not support a political candidate, kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any number of similar debate threads, your post will be removed.\n\n##13. No Revenge Stories\n\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge\u2014this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n\n##14. Comments and Flairing\n\nAfter 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post. OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period.\n\nIf you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.\n\n**YTA** = You're the Asshole; \n\n**NTA** = Not the A-hole; \n\n**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;\n \n**NAH** = No A-holes here; \n\n**INFO** = Not Enough Info \n\n##15. User Flairs\n\nWe award flairs for community members who distinguish themselves in their mastery of asshole judgment. If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point.

Report and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.\n\n_____________\n\n**\u2605 RULES \u2605**\n\n1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.\nWe do allow \"-> anywhere\" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.\n\n4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). \n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.\n\n* Can't find the answer you're looking for here?

Persistent engagement in antagonistic, uncivil or abusive behavior will result in action being taken against your account.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **2:** Anything not specifically concerning politics in the UK or geopolitics involving the UK will be removed.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **3:** Submission titles should use the headline of the article being submitted, and should be changed only where it improves clarity or is absolutely necessary. Changes that introduce editorialization or rhetoric will result in the submission being removed - please express your personal opinion in the comments, not the submission title. The subheading or a line from the 1st paragraph can be accepted where it aides clarity but should not be used for emphasis or to misrepresent the content being submitted.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **4a:** News articles older than one week will be removed. If an older article has relevance to events being discussed today, you should outline this argument in a self post that links to said article. On days where events move particularly fast, moderators may remove outdated news regardless of age.\n> \n> **4b:** Long form journalism published more than twelve months prior or before significant developments to the topic it discusses should be submitted as part of a self-post detailing why it is relevant today.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **5:** Articles from paywalled sites should be linked to directly, and a copy/paste, screenshot or outline.com link provided in the comments. Full credit to the author and publication should be given.

Tweets from random members of the public are not. This is auto-moderated as per our whitelist, but tweets from non-white listed accounts may be approved depending on context and notability. \n> \n> **7b:** Twitter posts which do not contribute substance or contain reactionary commentary regardless of author will generally be removed as \"hot takes\"\n> \n> **7c:** Threads should be submitted as a link submission identifying the Twitter thread in the title where possible. The contents of a thread should be posted as a text comment or link to an appropriate Thread Reader url.\n> \n> **7d:** Tweets that are just a link to an article and contain no commentary of substance will be removed. Said articles should submitted in place of the tweet with the accompanying tweet linked to in the comments.\n> \n> **7e:** Other social media sources or accounts that don't fit the criteria will continue to be reviewed manually.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **8:** Submitting your own content is perfectly fine, but make it clear that it's your own content and [read the site wide guidance on self promotion written by the admins](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **9:** Campaigning, fundraising, activism, e-begging and links to petitions will be removed.

Persistent harassment targeted at other subreddit users will result in the accounts involved being banned.\n> \n> **15b:** Persistent low-effort complaining about sources you disagree with, insulting the publication or trying to shame users for posting sources you disagree with is not acceptable. Either address the post in question, or ignore it.\n>\n> ---\n>  \n> **16:** If you see racist, homophobic etc comments please report them. Taking issue with immigration or refugee policy is not automatically racist.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **17:** Submissions or comments complaining about the moderation, biases or users of other subreddits will be removed and may result in a ban.

If you want to post a discussion or comic/meme, please ensure that it hasn't been posted recently (1 month for discussion, 4 months for comics/memes). |  \n*3* NSFW content must be tagged. | Any adult content that does not contain any real substance for discussion will be removed without warning. | \n*4* Stalking, harassment, and personal attacks will not be tolerated. | This rule we will take on a case by case basis. We consider intentionally baiting unproductive arguments as harassment. Other forms of harassment that we do not tolerate are personal attacks and stalking.\n*5*  No direct links to Fire Emblem ROMs or ISOs. | Fan patches/hacks are acceptable so long as they aren't pre-patched onto the original ROM/ISO. It's acceptable to discuss emulation without linking to illegal material.\n*6* Please use spoiler tags for major plot events, regardless of the game. | Not everyone has played every Fire Emblem game. It is only fair they get a chance to go into a story blind for the full experience. Titles must be spoiler free. To use a spoiler tag in comments, by typing \\>!Beware the Black Fang!!< gives you: >!Beware the Black Fang!!<. \n*7* All posts must be tagged appropriately!| Use the flair option after creating a post to tag it as needed. Upon selecting the appropriate flair, identify the game.\n*8* No Low Effort or Spam Posts | No Unedited Screen Shots, Simple Photo Edits, Simple Macro/Caption Memes, Photographs of game boxes/discs, or any other form of a low-effort post. Any images or memes must be related to Fire Emblem directly, and not just through a title or caption. Posts that serve no purpose and offer nothing are considered Spam. Any Low Effort or Spam post will be removed. \n*9* No Non-OC Fanart | No Fanart or Cosplay is to be posted unless it is of your own making, or you commissioned the artist and have permission to post.\n*10* Use the Question Thread | Simple or small questions must be asked in the question thread. A simple/small question is a question that can be answered in 1 sentence and doesn't generate discussion.\n*11* No unapproved bots | Many bots have a tendency to clog up comment sections and be generally annoying. If an unnecessary bot has posted in the sub, report it.\n*12* Have fun! | There are many games and different playstyles, as such there is no true way to play.

However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam.

If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed.

Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation.

This sub is for people with a wide variety of views, and as such you will come across content, views and people you don't agree with. Political views from a wide spectrum are tolerated here. Persistent engagement in antagonistic, uncivil or abusive behavior will result in action being taken against your account.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **2:** Anything not specifically concerning politics in the UK or geopolitics involving the UK will be removed.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **3:** Submission titles should use the headline of the article being submitted, and should be changed only where it improves clarity or is absolutely necessary. Changes that introduce editorialization or rhetoric will result in the submission being removed - please express your personal opinion in the comments, not the submission title. The subheading or a line from the 1st paragraph can be accepted where it aides clarity but should not be used for emphasis or to misrepresent the content being submitted.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **4a:** News articles older than one week will be removed. If an older article has relevance to events being discussed today, you should outline this argument in a self post that links to said article. On days where events move particularly fast, moderators may remove outdated news regardless of age.\n> \n> **4b:** Long form journalism published more than twelve months prior or before significant developments to the topic it discusses should be submitted as part of a self-post detailing why it is relevant today.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **5:** Articles from paywalled sites should be linked to directly, and a copy/paste, screenshot or outline.com link provided in the comments. Full credit to the author and publication should be given. Some websites may have different conditions applied due to copyright issues or differences in the design of their paywall, and result in automated instructions being sent which explain how to submit their content correctly. \n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **6:** If you want to discuss a specific point of an article rather than the article itself then please use a self post for this.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **7a:** Tweets are acceptable, so long as they are from journalists, pollsters, politicians and so forth. Tweets from random members of the public are not. This is auto-moderated as per our whitelist, but tweets from non-white listed accounts may be approved depending on context and notability. \n> \n> **7b:** Twitter posts which do not contribute substance or contain reactionary commentary regardless of author will generally be removed as \"hot takes\"\n> \n> **7c:** Threads should be submitted as a link submission identifying the Twitter thread in the title where possible. The contents of a thread should be posted as a text comment or link to an appropriate Thread Reader url.\n> \n> **7d:** Tweets that are just a link to an article and contain no commentary of substance will be removed. Said articles should submitted in place of the tweet with the accompanying tweet linked to in the comments.\n> \n> **7e:** Other social media sources or accounts that don't fit the criteria will continue to be reviewed manually.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **8:** Submitting your own content is perfectly fine, but make it clear that it's your own content and [read the site wide guidance on self promotion written by the admins](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **9:** Campaigning, fundraising, activism, e-begging and links to petitions will be removed. We all have issues that are close at heart, but the subreddit isn't the place for this. \n> \n> ---\n> \n> **10:** Self posts should be used as an invitation to discussion, not an opportunity to soapbox, tub-thump or showboat.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **11:** No meme posts, no shitposts. \n> \n> ---\n> \n> **12:** Surveys must be submitted in the form of a self post explaining what it is about, not a direct link.\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **13:** No URL shorteners, your post or comment will be immediately removed.\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **14:** Flairs should not contain links or abuse/insults. User flair that contains either will be deleted without warning, repeat offenders will be banned.\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **15a:** Comments and submissions that contribute nothing more than personal insults or group based attacks will be removed, along with low effort top level replies to submissions. Persistent harassment targeted at other subreddit users will result in the accounts involved being banned.\n> \n> **15b:** Persistent low-effort complaining about sources you disagree with, insulting the publication or trying to shame users for posting sources you disagree with is not acceptable. Either address the post in question, or ignore it.\n>\n> ---\n>  \n> **16:** If you see racist, homophobic etc comments please report them. Taking issue with immigration or refugee policy is not automatically racist.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **17:** Submissions or comments complaining about the moderation, biases or users of other subreddits will be removed and may result in a ban. This is not a meta subreddit.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **18:** Posting in other subreddits with the express purpose of brigading, vote manipulation or harassment in this subreddit may result in a permanent ban.\n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **19a:** Private messages to individual moderators regarding bans or removal of comments/posts will be ignored.\n> \n> **19b:** If you have any further questions or concerns about /r/ukpolitics moderation, feel free to ask, we'll be happy to discuss it publicly even if we can't reach agreement - although some issues (especially those involving complaints about other users) are best handled in modmail.\n> \n> **19c:** Persistent uncivil or abusive complaints about moderation or moderators may result in moderation action being taken against you. \n> \n> **19d:** If you do need to contact the moderators about anything, be descriptive and state what the issue is clearly. Please allow moderators sufficient time to respond.\n> \n> **19e:** If you report a submission or comment, make it clear why you are making a report. \n> \n> ---\n> \n> **20:** The report button is not a super-downvote button nor a guarantee that something will be done - moderators may decide no further action is required after reviewing a user submitted report. \n> \n> ---\n>  \n> **21:** Comments or submissions which call for/incite violence or threaten direct-action against political figures, journalists, commentators and media personalities in a way that constitutes illegal harassment or intimidation may result in a permanent ban and may be reported to the authorities.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **22:** Mime artists are strictly forbidden.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> **23:** These rules are not exhaustive, moderators reserve the right to moderate (or not) where it is felt to be appropriate. Past moderation decisions are no guarantee of future mod decisions. Rules are subject to change without notice.\n>, \"count_comments\":17}", "{ \"subreddit\":ApplyingToCollege,\"title\":ApplyingToCollege,description\":####/r/ApplyingToCollege is the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to SAT/ACT test prep, career guidance, and more.\n\n###[](#Yellow)\n>#Chatrooms\n\n>[Affirmative Action Discussion](https://s.reddit.com/channel/2348171_090d9ea10f373e3c8a8c267784a9ad0678b6ae34)\n\n>[Admissions Discussion](https://s.reddit.com/channel/2348171_c4f010dfd13d2c839a2b1d6d851c6a200db3b4df)\n\n>[Memes and Off-Topic Chat](https://s.reddit.com/channel/2348171_81de3d576b2b32dac8f33fd137ed13d92a5ff96d)\n\n>[Post-Application and College Life](https://s.reddit.com/channel/2348171_504411e5988e6e0d606255fae17f91ac7c52d1cc)\n\n> [**College Admissions Hub Discord**](https://discord.gg/n6W3pvr) \n\n#[](#Green)\n\n>#Rules for Participating\n\n>(A) **Do not attempt to start discussions about Affirmative Action.** They will be removed on sight.\n\n>(B) **Chance-me posts are prohibited**.
